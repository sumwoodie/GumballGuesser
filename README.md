# GumballGuesser
This project was inspired by the unending urge to win those pesky little 'guess the number of x in this jar'. Last fall the Roadrunner Cafe had a jar of candy corn out for people
to make a guess and whoever got the closest would win some prize. I thought it would be cool if a computer could make a guess and see how close it was.
